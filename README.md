# How to Retain Customers and Influence People
**Author:** Alexis Deviney

## Overview
This goal of this project is to recommend strategies to minimize customer churn (or service termination) from a fictional telecommunications company. In my analysis, I answered the following questions:
1. What customer demographics have the highest proportion of customer churn?
2. Is service/product engagement predictable of churn? Which products, when opted into, confer a lower probability of a customer to churn?
3. What services are the most profitable?
4. What is the tenure of customers who decide to churn? Are new or old customers churning?
6. Are longer contracts conducive to customer retention?

## Business Problem
Attracting new customers can be up to 5x more costly than retaining existing customers. 
Predict behavior to retain customers at Telco telecommunications company. Analyze all relevant customer data to help develop focused customer retention programs. 

## Data
I analyzed a data consisting of information on 7,043 unique customers and information relating to their demographics, account history, and services.
